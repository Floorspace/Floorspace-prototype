# Floorspace 

This project is similar to 99Acres, CommonFloor. But instead of creating an ad place online, Floorspace connects people with similar interest in constructing a house together either a builder floor or apartment. 

Market reasearch says that middle class people needs loans for buying/constructing a house. But it will cost a lot to buy a land without loan which middle class can't afford to pay in one shot. Hence this idea won't be scalable to much of the target market..

Prototype is built using flask python and tested.
